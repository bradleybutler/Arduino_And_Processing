# C++ Code for Arduino as well as Java for Processing

XboxRF24Control contains code done for MECH-202 at Colorado State University. This code properly uses an Xbox remote for control of an Arduino remotely through the use of RF24L01 modules. This is unique as this code utilizes communication through Processing and Arduino, and is my own code that does so.
